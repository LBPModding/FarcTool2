# About
### What is farctool2?
farctool2 is a program I wrote for two reasons:
1. To learn how Java can read and manipulate data streams, and
2. Because I already knew the structures of the file formats this game used.

### Why farctool "2"?
farctool2 is the sequel to the original farctool, which was written in Game Maker 8.0.

All researched data was acquired via means of downloading game package files through a public database of direct-to-PSN URLs with no protection.
Nothing malicious is intended. This program was written as a labor of love for the franchise and as a budding programmer's first major project.
